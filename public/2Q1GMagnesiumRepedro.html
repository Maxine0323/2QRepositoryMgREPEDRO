      <h2>History of UST</h2>
      <p>
        Founded on April 28, 1611, the University of Santo Tomas (UST) is recognized as the oldest existing university in Asia. Originally Bishop Miguel de Benavides, O.P. initiated the establishment of this institution to prepare young men for the priesthood, his personal library and funds became the start of UST’s history. UST has played a big role in shaping the education, Catholicism, and culture of the Philippines for over four centuries. From its humble beginnings as the Colegio de Nuestra Señora del Santisimo Rosario in Intramuros, it has grown into a world-renowned institution for learning. Today, UST proudly holds the title of being the largest Catholic university in the world located on a single campus. With their mission that aims to develop knowledgeable, competent, and compassionate individuals guided by faith and reason, dedicated to serving the Church, the nation, and the world. Along with their vision that by 2030, the University of Santo Tomas envisions becoming a leading Catholic university in the Asia-Pacific, dedicated to holistic education and social transformation. UST truly serves as an important asset to the students' morals and the Philippines' future generations to come.

      <h2>Student Life</h2>
      <p>
        Student life at UST is fun, exciting, and full of opportunities to grow. There is always something happening on campus—from joining different clubs and organizations to cheering for the Growling Tigers during UAAP season. These activities help students discover their interests, make new friends, and learn outside the classroom. UST also has special traditions like the Thomasian Welcome Walk, where freshmen pass through the Arch of the Centuries, and Paskuhan, the famous Christmas celebration filled with lights, music, and joy. Being a Thomasian isn’t just about studying; it’s about experiencing a lively community that helps you become a better, more compassionate person.
